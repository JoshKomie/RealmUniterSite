A most excellent event, Ambitious Ales Indie Game Night  put on by [Max](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ambitious-indie-game-night-3-tickets-224827393787) and [OC Drawing Royale](https://www.meetup.com/OC-Drawing-Royale/)!  



We had an awesome time playing games like "Rookie of the Year" by Two Rabbit Games and
[Hexachessagon](https://spherous.itch.io/hexachessagon) by Spherous Games just to name a couple. Watching folks play Realm Uniter
and getting our first feedback was so valuable. Thank you! The artists who drew pieces inspired by
the handful of games did incredible work! 
Check out this awesome sketch by an artist at the event. We dig the Adventure Time vibes.

We will most definitely be at the next one. See you there!
